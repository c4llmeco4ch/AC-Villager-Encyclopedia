# AC Villager Encyclopedia

## Intro to be added

## Technologies Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Web Scraping

## How To Run

While the goal will be to eventually make this much more user/non-programmer-friendly, this project is in a very early stage, so I have provided instructions to "install" below.

### Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Pip

For now, the first step is to copy the source code:

From the commandline, type

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c4llmeco4ch/AC-Villager-Encyclopedia.git
```

You should now have a directory called "AC-Villager-Encyclopedia".

To enter the folder, type

```bash
cd AC-Villager-Encyclopedia
```

To install all the dependencies, simply run

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to add "--user" to the end of the line on Windows or "sudo" at the beginning of the line on Linux if there are issues with installing due to lack of permissions.

Finally, run the program with the following command:

```bash
python3 parse_villagers.py
```
